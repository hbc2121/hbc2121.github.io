Comp20 Summer 2016
Lab 4

My portfolio was developed correctly to the best of my knowledge. I have 3 html pages, index.html, resume.html and bio.html.
index.html serves as the homepage and has links to my bio (bio.html), my resume (resume.html) and my LinkedIn profile. There
is an image of myself on index.html as well. The bio.html page and resume.html page meet the requirements as given by the 
lab specifications.I have a css file for each html page which defines the syling for each page. I have used at least 5 css rules.
All of the html pages and css pages have been validated.

I spent 6 hours on this assignment
